# Documentation of Assg1 Website aka Relentless Love Website

# I have made a band website for my band to showcase our work to fans and potential customers if they wish to hire/see us for a gig.
# The website contains videos and pictures of our music and work as well as upcoming news of any gigs that we might be peforming. This is to ensure that customers that would like to ask us to perform for them have confidence that we have experience and are passionate in music.

# Design Process:

# I decided to make this website as most bands have a website where fans can get more info about the band whether it was where they were playing next or even some music they have created. For example, https://www.ratm.com --- one of my favorite bands --- has a website to promote their latest projects or videos they have published to their socials and even a news section to inform their fans of the cancellation of tours or them being inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. I also thought as a user i wanted to access these websites with any kind of device for accessibility which is why i created multiple .css files to ensure that i could style the html files to fit most devices and give me an additional layer of creative freedom to style the pages as much as i like.

# Features:

# Image Slideshow - Allow users to see different pictures of the band as soon as they see the homepage.
# Audio Control - Allow users to hear different musical ideas that the band has come up with.

# Technology Used:

# Used Microsoft Co-Pilot for styling and media queries 
# Html used for layout and text of the webpage
# CSS used to make the webpage to look aestheticly pleasing
# Javascript for the image slideshow animation
